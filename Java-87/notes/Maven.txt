Application Build Process

-> Create a new Project (a web project)

-> For developing a project we need to create project folder structure first
 folder structure format may be different for different applications - like web applications, distributed applications, enterprise application 

-> We need to download libraries (jars) required for our project
	Ex: Spring, Hibernate, Webservices etc...

-> We need to add all required jars to project build path

-> We need to compile all classes available in our project

-> We need to execute Unit Test Cases (Junit methods) available in our project

-> We need to package our project as a jar/war file for deployment

- By using build tools we can automate build process (otherwise all the above steps to be done manually).

- Below are the build tools available in market
		a) Ant  (Outdated)[an acronym for Another Neat Tool) is an XML based build tool.]
		b) Maven
		c) Gradle
